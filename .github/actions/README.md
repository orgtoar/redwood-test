# README

This directory contains custom GitHub Actions used in the workflow files in the `.github/workflows` directory.
Normally they're GitHub Actions with the `action.yml` file and everything, but some are just Node.js scripts. (If you can get away with just a Node.js script, do it.)

Note that there are a few actions that are useful enough to run locally that are in the `tasks` directory.
