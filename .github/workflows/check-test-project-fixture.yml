# Check if, based on the changes in a PR, the test project fixture needs to be updated.
#
# The test project fixture is used in the "âš™ CI" workflow's "Smoke test" job.
# It's important to keep it up to date. If it's not updated, we're testing old versions of redwood,
# which could lead to false positives.
