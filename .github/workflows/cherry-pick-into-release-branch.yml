# When a PR is merged into the main branch, this workflow tries to cherry pick the squashed commit into the release branch using:
#
# ```
# git switch release
# git cherry-pick --ff $GITHUB_SHA
# ```
#
# Which cherry picks the squashed commit into the release branch, "fast forwarding" if it can, keeping the history the same.
#
# If it can't fast forward (i.e. main and release have diverged), it'll open PR against release with the squashed commit.
# See the end of ci.yml for that.
