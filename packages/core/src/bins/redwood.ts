/**
 * A proxy for running the "redwood" @redwoodjs/cli bin (`yarn redwood`, or `yarn rw`) from @redwoodjs/core.
 *
 * createRequire is for ES modules. require literally doesn't exist in ES modules,
 * so if you want to use it, you have to create it.
 *
 * But that's not why we're using it here. We're using it here to require files from other packages for yarn 3 reasons:
 *
 * > If your package is something that automatically loads plugins (for example eslint),
 * > peer dependencies obviously aren't an option as you can't reasonably list all plugins.
 * > Instead, you should use the createRequire function to load plugins on behalf of the configuration file
 * > that lists the plugins to load, be it the package.json or a custom one like the .eslintrc.js file.
 *
 * See...

// Some random comment

// You can think about the argument we're passing to `createRequire` as being kinda like setting the `cwd`:
//
// > It's using the path/URL to resolve relative paths (e.g.: createRequire('/foo/bar')('./baz') may load /foo/baz/index.js)
//
// See https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/40567#issuecomment-949825461.
