// where an element of its list may be placed in the given subarray. Each list-rule-pair can be
// thought of as a category of elements that have particular ordering concerns.
// The algorithm returns a minimally-sized array of arrays, where each element occurs exactly once
// in one of the subarrays, and none of the ordering rules are violated.
// It is assumed that no rule prevents an element from being placed alone in its own subarray.
